      Hi, glad you're here! My name is Eldad, I am married to Reut and father to
      Omer and Ofri. My goal is to succeed and overcome every obstacle. I
      learned Fullstack at Coding Academy. Currently I works for about a year as
      a fullstack developer in a hi-tech company in the south. I have two
      degrees in education, and in my free time I like to ride my bike, play
      music, and of course, write code ðŸ˜€.</span
